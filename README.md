The repository to change mankind!
Greetings.  My name is NNIZ.  I know nothing about doing a lot of this stuff, however, that might be a good thing.  I want to fix and find the errors in our mathmatical system.  It is my theory that it has been purposely comprimised, so that ordinary man can only achieve so much of a level of sophisticated technology.  I propose a huge emphasis on base 6 or base 3 mathmatics as a solution to all of our mathmatical problems.  I welcome anyone that has a passion for changing our planet and our own lives for the better, to contribute to this repository.
